==========

Your contributions are welcome!
The preferred way to contribute to EstimationPy is via
issues and pull requests on Github.

Please follow this process:

1. Generate an issue that describes the problem that you encountered or the
feature you'd like to see implemented.

2. Either wait for someone to solve/implement and discuss about the issue you
generated or create a branch with a proposal for the implementation and create
a pull request.

3. Before submitting a pull request with your proposal please add new tests
in ``EstimationPy/estimationpy/tests`` to verify that your solution works
and it does not brake the existing code base.
