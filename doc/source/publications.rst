The article titled
`If buildings could tell us what's wrong <http://eetd.lbl.gov/news/article/58903/if-buildings-could-tell-us-what>`_
was posted on November 2014 on the LBNL Energy Technologies Area website.
The article showcases an application build with **EstimationPy**. In particular, the application
uses **EstimationPy** to identify faults in buildings and enrergy systems.
