Installation
============

EstimationPy provides functionalities for estimating state variables
and parameters of dynamic system represented as Functional Mockup Units (FMU).
An FMU is a simulation model that is compliant with the FMI standard.
FMUs can be generated by tools such as Dymola, Matlab or EnergyPlus.
The FMU is a wrapper around a simulation software that exposes a
standardize C API. The details of the C API are specified by the
FMI standard. Please, visit http://www.fmi-standard.org for more
information about the standard and which tools support it.

EstimationPy relies on the Python package `PyFMI <http://www.pyfmi.org>`_
for simulating the FMUs. PyFMI itself has multiple dependencies
that need to be satisfied in order to be used.
PyFMI can be either installed as a standalone package, or can be
installed as part of the more comprehensive set of packages provided
by `JModelica <http://www.jmodelica.org>`_.
